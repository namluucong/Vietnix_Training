### 19. Standard Input, Output, Error.
- When a command begins running, it usually expects that the following files are already open: **standard input, standard output, and standard error**  
-  When you enter a command, if no file name is given, your keyboard is the **standard input**, sometimes denoted as **stdin**. When a command finishes, the results are displayed on your screen.

- Your screen is the **standard output**, sometimes denoted as **stdout**. By default, commands take input from the standard input and send the results to **standard output**.

- Error messages are directed to **standard error**, sometimes denoted as **stderr**. By default, this is your screen.

<div id='20'></div>

### 20. Redirecting Standard Input, Output, Error.
- When the notation **>** filename is added to the end of a command, the output of the command is written to the specified file name. The **>** symbol is known as the **output redirection** operator.
- When the notation **<** filename is added to the end of a command, the input of the command is read from the specified file name. The **<** symbol is known as the **input redirection operator**.
- In addition to the **standard input and standard output**, commands often produce other types of output, such as error or status messages known as diagnostic output. Like **standard output, standard error output** is written to the screen unless it is redirected.
